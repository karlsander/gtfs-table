# gtfs-table

A quick command line script to fetch a gtfs archive and generate timetables as csv for spreadsheet import.

This is not really polished for public use and might not even reliably return the right data. If you want you to use it and it doesn't work out feel free to contact me though.

## Usage

```
gtfs-table --name outputFolder --url https://agency.com/gtfs
```
